// SXPloadouts.hpp
// Used for defining advanced respawn loadouts for players
// Default behaviour is to check if the player unit has a special loadout defined. Otherwise, it will check to see if the classname matches a loadout
// Advanced functionality allows mission creator to define exactly where items are placed in unit inventories
// Also supports sub-loadout randomization. If a loadout has sub-classes defined, the script will automatically select one of them to apply to the unit.
